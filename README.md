# Web Kitchen - Recipe Sharing Platform



Web Kitchen is a modern recipe-sharing platform built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Router**. It allows users to explore featured recipes, sign up, log in, and share their culinary creations with the community.

I have tried new things here, like rendering icons as a component from Lucid React, Using dynamic links of photos from unsplash rather than using photos itself. This might be the best try to make code more component based and lower in size.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and protect routes using a custom `ProtectedRoute` component.
- **Featured Recipes**: Browse a collection of featured recipes with details like title, chef, and preparation time.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive user interface.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for recipes using the integrated search bar.
- **Protected Routes**: Restrict access to certain pages (e.g., home) for authenticated users only.


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS
  - React Router (v6)
  - Lucide React (for icons)

- **Other Tools**:
  - VS Code
  - Git & GitHub
